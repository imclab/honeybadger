APIS: Twilio, Face, Aviary, Facebook

This is an app that turns your laptop into a motion-detecing, face-matching, meme-generating madness machine. Just register with your number and start monitoring - the screen shows a fake reddit background while the camera takes pictures to see if anyone uses your computer while you're away. If they do, it identifies them (if they're your facebook friend), texts you about it, and tells them to royally fuck off.
